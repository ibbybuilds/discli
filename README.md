Create channels, manage roles, set permissions, and control your Discord servers from the terminal.

No bot server needed. No dashboard clicking. Just commands.

> Your AI agent ([AIOS Companion](https://aioscompanion.com), OpenClaw, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) can use discli to manage your Discord server. Create channels, assign roles, rename everything, in seconds.

## Why discli?

Setting up a Discord server manually is slow. Using bots for management is limited. MCP tools eat your token budget.

discli gives you direct control over Discord through simple CLI commands:

```bash
discli channel create "💬・general" --category "Community"
discli role create "Moderator" --color "#ff5733"
discli perm lock "📜・rules"
discli channel rename "old-name" "🎯・new-name"
```

One command = one API call. No bot server. No token overhead.

<br>

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @ibbybuilds/discli

# Or run directly without installing
npx @ibbybuilds/discli --help

# Setup (paste your bot token)
discli init --token YOUR_BOT_TOKEN

# Start managing
discli channel list
discli server info
```

<details>
<summary><strong>🔑 How to get a bot token</strong></summary>

<br>

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a new application
3. Go to **Bot** > **Reset Token** > copy it
4. Go to **Installation** > set **Guild Install** scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands` with **Administrator** permission
5. Use the install link to add the bot to your server
6. Run `discli init --token YOUR_TOKEN`

> 💡 **Permissions tip:** Administrator gives discli full access, but you don't have to. You can select only the permissions you need (Manage Channels, Manage Roles, etc.). Some features won't work without specific permissions, but you stay in control of what the bot can do.

## ⚠️ Safety

**When using with AI agents:** Always review commands before approving. Destructive commands like `channel delete`, `member kick`, and `member ban` require `--confirm` but your agent may add that flag automatically. Make sure your agent setup asks for your approval before running destructive actions.

<br>

## 🤖 For AI Agents

discli is designed for AI agents like [AIOS Companion](https://aioscompanion.com), OpenClaw, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and others.

### How agents use it

1. 📦 Install discli globally or use npx
2. 📄 Agent reads the skill file and learns all available commands
3. ⚡ Agent runs commands and manages your server through the terminal

### Agent-friendly features

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| 📊 YAML output by default | 5x fewer tokens than JSON when piped |
| 🔢 `-n` flag | Limit results to save tokens |
| 👀 `--dry-run` | Preview changes before applying |
| ✋ `--confirm` required | Destructive commands never auto-execute |
| 🔄 Structured exit codes | `0` success, `1` error, `2` usage, `3` not found, `4` forbidden |
| 📐 SCHEMA.md | Documents output shapes for predictable parsing |
| ⚡ No MCP overhead | Zero token cost at session start |

### Install the CLI

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @ibbybuilds/discli

# Or run directly (no install needed)
npx @ibbybuilds/discli channel list
```

### Install the skill

```bash
# Option 1: via npx skills (if you have skills.sh)
npx skills add ibbybuilds/discli

# Option 2: copy from GitHub (works everywhere)
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/discli
curl -o ~/.claude/skills/discli/SKILL.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibbybuilds/discli/master/skills/SKILL.md
```

> Example shown for Claude Code. Replace `~/.claude/skills/` with your agent's skill directory.

### Give your bot a personality (SOUL.md)

Your bot doesn't have to sound like a robot. discli supports a `SOUL.md` file that defines your bot's personality, tone, and quirks. When your agent sends messages or reacts as your bot, it reads this file first and stays in character.

```bash
# The agent will ask you about your bot's personality and generate this file
~/.discli/SOUL.md
```

You define things like:
- **Name and identity** -- who is your bot?
- **Tone** -- casual lowercase? formal? chaotic?
- **Personality traits** -- cheeky, helpful, sarcastic, wholesome?
- **Emoji preferences** -- which ones, how often?
- **How it talks to different people** -- owner vs community vs new members

The agent creates the file after a short conversation about what you want. Every bot gets its own voice.

> Inspired by OpenClaw's SOUL.md system.

### Example: agent sets up an entire server

```
You: "Set up my Discord like a dev community with channels for
      general chat, code help, AI tools, and read-only announcements"

Agent runs:
  discli channel create "Community" --type category
  discli channel create "💬・general" --category Community
  discli channel create "💻・code-help" --category Community
  discli channel create "🤖・ai-tools" --category Community
  discli channel create "📢・announcements" --category Info
  discli perm lock "📢・announcements"
```

<br>

## 🏁 Global Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--format <yaml\|json\|table\|auto>` | Output format. Default: auto (YAML when piped, table in terminal) |
| `--server <id>` | Target a specific server instead of default |
| `-n <count>` | Limit results on list commands |
| `--dry-run` | Preview changes without applying |
| `--confirm` | Required for destructive actions (delete, kick, ban) |

<br>

## ⚙️ How It Works

discli is not a bot. It's a thin CLI wrapper around the [Discord REST API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference).

```
discli channel create "test"
    ↓
POST https://discord.com/api/v10/guilds/{id}/channels
Authorization: Bot {your_token}
Body: {"name": "test", "type": 0}
    ↓
Channel created. Done.
```

No WebSocket connection. No bot process. No server hosting. Your bot can be offline and commands still work.

<br>

## 🔐 Bring Your Own Bot

discli uses your bot token. You create the bot, you control the permissions, you own the data. Nothing is sent to us.

```
~/.discli/
├── config.json    # default server
└── .env           # your bot token (never leaves your machine)
```

<br>
